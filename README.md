# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
In this analysis we are helping the manager at Pewlett-Hackard prepare for the "silver tsunami", onset by the increase in retirement of baby boomers. We used the PostgreSQL database to conduct this analysis. In the analysis we gathered information on the number of retiring employees by title, and the retiring employees who are eligible for the mentorship program. This analysis helps the managers plan for the future at Pewlett-Hackard, and the measures that need to be taken to deal with the large employee shift.
